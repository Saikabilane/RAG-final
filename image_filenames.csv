image46.jpeg,Pharynx The pharynx runs from the nostrils to the esophagus and the larynx.
image47.jpeg,Esophagus The upper esophageal sphincter controls the movement of food from the pharynx to the esophagus. The lower esophageal sphincter controls the movement of food from the esophagus to the stomach.
image48.jpeg, Deglutition Deglutition includes the voluntary phase and two involuntary phases: the pharyngeal phase and the esophageal phase.
image49.jpeg,---------------------
image50.jpeg,Stomach The stomach has four major regions: the cardia fundus body and pylorus. The addition of an inner oblique smooth muscle layer gives the muscularis the ability to vigorously churn and mix food.
image51.jpeg,Histology of the Stomach The stomach wall is adapted for the functions of the stomach. In the epithelium gastric pits lead to gastric glands that secrete gastric juice. The gastric glands (one gland is shown enlarged on the right) contain different types of cells that secrete a variety of enzymes including hydrochloride acid which activates the protein-digesting enzyme pepsin.
image52.jpeg,----------------
image53.jpeg,The Three Phases of Gastric Secretion Gastric secretion occurs in three phases: cephalic gastric and intestinal. During each phase the secretion of gastric juice can be stimulated or inhibited.
image54.jpeg,Small Intestine The three regions of the small intestine are the duodenum jejunum and ileum.

image64.jpeg,-------------
image65.jpeg,Exocrine and Endocrine Pancreas The pancreas has a head a body and a tail. It delivers pancreatic juice to the duodenum through the pancreatic duct.
image66.jpeg,Gallbladder The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile and releases it into the two-way cystic duct when it is needed by the small intestine.
image67.jpeg,Digestion and Absorption Digestion begins in the mouth and continues as food travels through the small intestine. Most absorption occurs in the small intestine.
image68.jpeg, Carbohydrate Digestion Flow Chart Carbohydrates are broken down into their monomers in a series of steps.
image69.jpeg,Digestion of Protein The digestion of protein begins in the stomach and is completed in the small intestine.
image70.jpeg,Digestion of Protein Flow Chart Proteins are successively broken down into their amino acid components
image71.jpeg,Digestive Secretions and Absorption of Water Absorption is a complex process in which nutrients from digested food are harvested.
image72.jpeg,Lipid Absorption Unlike amino acids and simple sugars lipids are transformed as they are absorbed through epithelial cells.
image73.jpeg,Structure of ATP Molecule Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy molecule of the cell. During catabolic reactions ATP is created and energy is stored until needed during anabolic reactions.
image74.jpeg,Sources of ATP During catabolic reactions proteins are broken down into amino acids lipids are broken down into fatty acids and polysaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides. These building blocks are then used for the synthesis of molecules in anabolic reactions.
image75.jpeg,Cellular Respiration Cellular respiration oxidizes glucose molecules through glycolysis the Krebs cyclemand oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP.
image76.jpeg,Glycolysis Overview During the energy-consuming phase of glycolysis two ATPs are consumed transferring two phosphates to the glucose molecule.
image77.jpeg,---------------------
image78.jpeg,Aerobic versus Anaerobic Respiration The process of anaerobic respiration converts glucose into two lactate molecules in the absence of oxygen or within erythrocytes that lack mitochondria. During aerobic respiration glucose is oxidized into two pyruvate molecules.
image79.jpeg,Krebs Cycle During the Krebs cycle each pyruvate that is generated by glycolysis is converted into a two-carbon acetyl CoA molecule. The acetyl CoA is systematically processed through the cycle and produces high energy NADH FADH2 and ATP molecules.
image80.jpeg,---------------------
image81.jpeg,---------------------
image82.jpeg,Electron T ransport Chain The electron transport chain is a series of electron carriers and ion pumps that are used to pump H+ ions out of the inner mitochondrial matrix.
image83.jpeg,Carbohydrate Metabolism Carbohydrate metabolism involves glycolysis the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain.
image84.jpeg,Gluconeogenesis Gluconeogenesis is the synthesis of glucose from pyruvate lactate glycerol alanine or glutamate.
image85.jpx,-------------------
image86.jpeg,Chylomicrons Chylomicrons contain triglycerides cholesterol molecules and other apolipoproteins (protein molecules). They function to carry these water-insoluble molecules from the intestine through the lymphatic system and into the bloodstream which carries the lipids to adipose tissue for storage.
image87.jpeg,Breakdown of Fatty Acids During fatty acid oxidation triglycerides can be broken down into acetyl CoA molecules and used for energy when glucose levels are low.
image88.jpeg,Ketogenesis Excess acetyl CoA is diverted from the Krebs cycle to the ketogenesis pathway. This reaction occurs in the mitochondria of liver cells. The result is the production of β-hydroxybutyrate the primary ketone body found in the blood.
image89.jpeg,Ketone Oxidation When glucose is limited ketone bodies can be oxidized to produce acetyl CoA to be used in the Krebs cycle to generate energy.
image90.jpeg,Lipid Metabolism Lipids may follow one of several pathways during metabolism. Glycerol and fatty acids follow different pathways.
image91.jpeg,Digestive Enzymes and Hormones Enzymes in the stomach and small intestine break down proteins into amino acids. HCl in the stomach aids in proteolysis and hormones secreted by intestinal cells direct the digestive processes.
image92.jpeg,Urea Cycle Nitrogen is transaminated creating ammonia and intermediates of the Krebs cycle. Ammonia is processed in the urea cycle to produce urea that is eliminated through the kidneys.
image93.jpeg,Energy from Amino Acids Amino acids can be broken down into precursors for glycolysis or the Krebs cycle. Amino acids (in bold) can enter the cycle through more than one pathway.
image94.jpeg,Catabolic and Anabolic Pathways Nutrients follow a complex pathway from ingestion through anabolism and catabolism to energy production.
image95.jpeg,Absorptive State During the absorptive state the body digests food and absorbs the nutrients.
image96.jpeg,Postabsorptive State During the postabsorptive state the body must rely on stored glycogen for energy.

image150.jpeg,Spermatogenesis (a) Mitosis of a spermatogonial stem cell involves a single cell division that results in two identical diploid daughter cells (spermatogonia to primary spermatocyte). Meiosis has two rounds of cell division: primary spermatocyte to secondary spermatocyte and then secondary spermatocyte to spermatid. This produces four haploid daughter cells (spermatids). 
image151.jpeg,------------------------
