image202.jpg,Pulmonary Function Testing Respiratory capacity is the combination of two or more selected volumes
image203.jpg,The result is typically a rhythmic consistent ventilation rate that provides the body with sufficient amounts of oxygen while adequately removing carbon dioxide.
image204.jpg,the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the mixture.
image205.jpg,As a result the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide change affecting the diffusion process that moves these materials across the membrane. This will cause oxygen to enter and carbon dioxide to leave the blood more quickly
image206.jpg,An increase in altitude results in a decrease in atmospheric pressure. Although the proportion of oxygen relative to gases in the atmosphere remains at 21 percent its partial pressure decreases
image207.jpg,Hormones secreted by several endocrine glands as well as endocrine cells of the pancreas the stomach and the small intestine contribute to the control of digestion and nutrient metabolism. In turn the digestive system provides the nutrients to fuel endocrine function.
image208.jpg,Note that during fetal development certain digestive structures including the first portion of the small intestine (called the duodenum) the pancreas and portions of the large intestine (the ascending and descending colon and the rectum) remain completely or partially posterior to the peritoneum. Thus the location of these organs is described as retroperitoneal
image209.jpg,The digestive system uses mechanical and chemical activities to break fooddown into absorbable substances during its journey through the digestive system.
image210.jpg,The most common form dental caries (cavities) develops when colonies of bacteria feeding on sugars in the mouth release acids that cause soft tissue inflammation and degradation of the calcium crystals of the enamel.
image211.jpg,As mentioned previously the most superficial layer of the esophagus is called the adventitia not the serosa. In contrast to the stomach and intestines the loose connective tissue of the adventitia is not covered by a fold of visceral peritoneum. The digestive functions of the esophagus are identified in
image212.jpg,describes the digestive functions of important hormones secreted by the stomach.
image213.jpg,The submucosa of the duodenum is the only site of the complex mucus-secreting duodenal glands(Brunner’sglands) which produce a bicarbonate-rich alkaline mucus that buffers the acidic chyme as it enters from the stomach.
image214.jpg,This is accomplished by enzymes through hydrolysis. The many enzymes involved in chemical digestion are summarized in 
image215.jpg,The large food molecules that must be broken down into subunits are summarized
image216.jpg, The absorption of most nutrients through the mucosa of the intestinal villi requires active transport fueled by ATP. The routes of absorption for each food category are summarized
image217.jpg,summarizes the function of each of the catabolic hormones
image218.jpg,summarizesthefunctions of the anabolic hormones.

image220.jpg,Therefore hyper vitaminos is of water-solublevitamins rarelyoccurs except with an excess of vitamin supplements
image221.jpg,Major mineral
image222.jpg,Trace mineral
image223.jpg,Characteristics of the urine change depending on influences such as water intake exercise environmental temperature nutrient intake and other factors
image224.jpg,Urine volume varies considerably. The normal range is one to two liters per day
image225.jpg, Failure of the renal anatomy and/or physiology can lead suddenly or gradually to renal failure. In this event a number of symptoms signs or laboratory findings point to the diagnosis
image226.jpg, Ninety-nine percent of this filtrate is returned to the circulation by reabsorption so that only about 1–2 liters of urine are produced per day
image227.jpg,That recovery occurs in the PCT loop of Henle DCT and the collecting ducts
image228.jpg, Acid–base balance is maintained through actions of the lungs and kidneys: The lungs rid the body of H+ whereas the kidneys secrete or reabsorb H+ and HCO3– 
image229.jpg, The numbers and particular types of pumps and channels vary between the apical and basilar surfaces 
image230.jpg, This mechanism stimulates either contraction or relaxation of afferent arteriolar smooth muscle cells 
image231.jpg,lists the reference values for blood plasma cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine for the six ions addressed in this section. In a clinical setting sodium potassium and chloride are typically analyzed in a routine urine sample.
image232.jpg,lists some other causes of metabolic acidosis.
image233.jpg,lists the conditions and laboratory results that can be used to classify these conditions.
image234.jpg,Different sex steroid hormone concentrations between the sexes also contribute to the development and function of secondary sexual characteristics. Examples of secondary sexual characteristics are listed in
image235.jpg, As a fully developed organ the placenta provides nutrition and excretion respiration and endocrine function
image236.jpg, Additional breast tissue and dramatically increased blood volume also contribute to weight gain
image237.jpg, In the final weeks of pregnancy the alveoli swell with colostrum a thick yellowish substance that is high in protein but contains less fat and glucose than mature breast milk 
image238.jpg, In both cases the person is blood type A. Because IA masks i we say that IA is dominant to i. Table 28.4 summarizes the expression of blood type
